## Index by Master

- Formal Methods
    - [Calculus of Information Systems](https://github.com/pCosta99/Masters/tree/master/MFES/CSI) - Relational approach to Program Calculation by design. Working at a higher level allows us to perform powerful proofs using somewhat simple (but progressively more complex) concepts.
    - [Specification and Modeling](https://github.com/pCosta99/Masters/tree/master/MFES/EM) - First-order, second-order (relation) and temporal logic used with Alloy/Electrum in order to specify models about anything and reason about their properties.
    - [Software Testing and Analysis](https://github.com/pCosta99/Masters/tree/master/MFES/ATS) - Unit Testing, QuickCheck for log generation and property testing, analysing metrics and code smells and refactoring Java code.

- Distributed Systems
    - [Distributed Systems Fundamentals](https://github.com/pCosta99/Masters/tree/master/SD/FSD) - Mostly focused on working with asynchronous socket types, Completable Future being the most advanced methods we used for dealing with those sockets.
    - [Distributed Systems Paradigms](https://github.com/pCosta99/Masters/tree/master/SD/PSD) - Learned about different architectures used commonly in Distributed Systems such as Actor and Event Oriented Programming, REST API's, 0MQ middleware (PUB-SUB, PUSH-PULL, REQ-REP architectures) and a very small contact with Protocol Buffers.
    - [Systems Deployment and Benchmarking](https://github.com/pCosta99/Masters/tree/master/SD/SDB) - Fully automated methods of setting up complex applications in distributed architectures. Also learned about planning those architectures keeping in mind perfomance and scalability.
