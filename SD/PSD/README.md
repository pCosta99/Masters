# Project - Stayaway Covid

In this project we designed a potential StayawayCovid-like application using several tecnologies:
- Client Application - Made in Java, used TCP sockets to communicate with the Frontend Server.
- Frontend Server - Made in Erlang (:heart:).
- Backend Servers + Broker - Made in Java.
    - Used 0MQ middleware, more especifically, PUB-SUB and PUSH-PULL architectures.
- REST API - Made in Java using [DropWizard](https://dropwizard.io/).

We also worked with Google's Protocol Buffers for this project and, I must say, they are absolutely amazing.
